    Computer programmers and hobbyists at times come across situations where they need to switch a light bulb, rotate a motor or measure a temperature under software control. Generally these things are done by connecting some extra hardware to the computer and coding it in C language. KuttyPy is a USB interfaced board that gives you an option to do those things in pure Python.

    <br/>
    <p>Participants will also get a chance to try some hands on experiments with ExpEYES -python powered open source pocket science lab. It is a hardware & software framework for developing science experiments, demonstrations and projects without getting in to the details of electronics or computer programming. It converts your PC into a science laboratory.
