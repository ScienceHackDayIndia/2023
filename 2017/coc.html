      <h2>Science Hack Day India</h2>
      <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
      <h3>The short version</h3>
      <p>Science Hack Day India is an inclusive event based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, ethnicity and religion (or lack thereof). We feel it is important to make clear that harassment of any kind will not be tolerated and that if any issues arise they will be dealt with in a serious manner. Fortunately, we have never had a problem with this and the event organisers are actively committed to making sure  that this remain the case. Science Hack Day India has always been a friendly social event, so if that isn’t something you can get behind please don’t come. If you come and act nasty or mean, we will ask you to leave. Be nice. Be considerate. Be civil. It’s easy.</p>
      <h3>The Longer version</h3>
      <p>Science Hack Day India is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of Science Hack Day India participants in any form. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the event organizers. Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the organising team immediately. The organising team will have checked you in and will be doing all the announcements during the event. The organising team will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We really value your attendance. We expect participants to follow these rules during the entirety of the event.</p>
