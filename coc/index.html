  <h2>The Short Version</h2>
<p>
  Science Hack Day India is an inclusive event based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of gender,
  sexual orientation, age, disability, ethnicity and religion (or lack thereof). We feel it is important to make clear
  that harassment of any kind will not be tolerated and that if any issues arise they will be dealt with in a serious
  manner. Fortunately, we have never had a problem with this and the event organisers are actively committed to making
  sure that this remain the case.
  <br/>
  Science Hack Day India has always been a friendly social event, so if that isn't something you can get behind please
  don't come. If you come and act nasty or mean, we will ask you to leave. Be nice. Be considerate. Be civil. It's easy.
</p>

<h2>The Long Version</h2>
<p>
  Science Hack Day India is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender
  identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do
  not tolerate harassment of Science Hack Day India participants in any form. Event participants violating these rules
  may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the event organizers. Harassment includes verbal
  comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
  orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate 
  intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
  inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are
  expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they
  deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. If you are being harassed, notice that
  someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the organising team immediately.
  The organising team will have checked you in and will be doing all the announcements during the event. The organising team
  will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist
  those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We really value your attendance. We expect
  participants to follow these rules during the entirety of the event.
</p>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>

<h3>Stay safe</h3>
<p>
  We want to provide a safe environment for everyone. This requires taking some precautions regarding health and safety during the event. Your project might require dangerous tools or chemicals to work out. Before you do anything that could potentially harm you or others, come and talk to one of the organisers. This includes, but is not limited to,
  <br/>
  <ul>
    <li>Lasers (anything above class 1, like the laser diode out of a DVD drive)</li>
    <li>Fast moving, heavy tools (angle grinders, electric saws…)</li>
    <li>Chemicals (bases or acids, bleach, solvents, alcoholic compounds…)</li>
    <li>Loud or explosive devices (sirens, fireworks…)</li>
    <li>Any other kind of explosive or flammable material.</li>
  </ul>
  Before you attempt to do anything that could pose a risk to you or others, talk to the organisers. They will not stop you from completing your project. You might just have to take certain precautions to reduce risk of harm for everyone around you. In general, we aim to allow as much as possible as long as we talked about it before.
  <br/>
  If we find you using any dangerous tool or material without having talked to us first, we will have to take consequences that can lead up to the exclusion from the event in extreme (but so far very rare) cases.
