# Call for Sponsors

[**Sponsorship Prospectus**](https://github.com/ScienceHackDayIndia/sciencehackday.in/raw/master/assets/data/SHD-Belgaum-Sponsorship-2018.pdf "Sponsorship Prospectus")

## What is Science Hack Day India?

Science Hack Day India is volunteer-organized event. We are team of passionate volunteers and we know what it takes to make a great event. This is the 3rd edition of the event happening at Belgaum on 2-4 November 2018.

It is all-day-all-night event that brings together inquisitive and creative minds to one place, to make wonderful things. Designers, developers, engineers, scientists and artists proudly bring their A-game to the same physical space for a brief but intense period of collaboration, making, hacking, and building of ‘cool stuff’. By collaborating on focused tasks during this short period, small groups of makers are capable of producing remarkable results.

## Audience Profile

Science Hack Day India is attended by 100 of the brightest and most creative people this part of the world has to offer. Coming from all backgrounds they don’t just talk the talk at Science Hack Day they roll up their sleeves and get their hands dirty. They are the people who are driven to go that little bit further to make great things and we love them.

SHD India  will also gather about 100 high-school kids and about 100 undergraduate students from engineering and science background around the mission of getting excited and making things with science. This amazing gathering will have young scientists, engineers, computer programmers, teachers, nature lovers, hackers, makers,  and grassroot innovators. 

## Diversity

Above all Science Hack Day is a Hackathon for everyone. We strive to create a welcoming and social event where people working together and sharing their skills  just makes sense. We want Science Hack Day to include people of all races, all genders, all level of experience, all religious beliefs, and all sexual orientations. We believe a good hackathon should reflect the society it takes place in, by excluding anyone it is the event that suffers.  In effort to level the playing field we offer childcare and travel bursaries to those it will help.

## Sponsor Us


Major components of our expenses are Accomodation for our national / international  participants , Food arrangements for about 325 members  and tools and materials required for hacking activity and student workshops.
It's only due to the graciousness of our sponsors that  we'll all be fueled with food, shelter and the various necessities for our hacking. We appeal you to be a part of this mission to inspire our generation and create sparks  for future ideas and grassroot innovations. 

We wouldn’t be able to do all this without our sponsors.
