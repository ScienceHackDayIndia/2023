      <p>
        Science Hack Day is a three-day event where anyone excited about making weird,
        silly or serious things with science comes together in the same physical space
        to see what they can prototype within 36 consecutive hours. Designers, developers,
        artists, scientists and people from any background are welcome to attend – no
        experience in science or hacking is necessary, just an insatiable curiosity.
        The event is organized by volunteers, and supported via sponsors. SHD India
        2022 will be our 5th annual event!
      </p>
      <p>
        The mission of Science Hack Day is simply to get excited and make things with
        science! People organically form multidisciplinary teams over the course of a
        weekend: particle physicists team up with designers, marketers join forces with
        open source rocket scientists, writers collaborate with molecular biologists,
        and developers partner with school kids. By collaborating on focused tasks
        during this short period, small groups of hackers are capable of producing remarkable
        results. To date, there have been over 60 Science Hack Day events across 22 countries
        around the globe and more are being planned which are listed on the Global SHD site.

          Sankalpbhoomi -The farm resort, totally in tune with nature in its rustic
          uncorrupted state, stands testimony to saving nature. It was once an abandoned
          quarry, today natures glory restored. The resort resembles an enchanting oasis,
          with a thick set of trees, sprawling lawns, and a large lagoon surrounded by
          picturesque expansive rock walls as backdrop. The venue provides perfect space
          and ambience for all hacking/making activities. It also offers a complete
          rejuvenating and relaxing experience for all SHD participants to return with
