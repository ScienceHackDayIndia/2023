  <h2 class="section-title">What is Science Hack Day</h2>
<p>
  Science Hack Day is a three-day event where anyone excited about making weird, silly or serious things with
  science comes together in the same physical space to see what they can prototype within 36 consecutive hours.
  Designers, developers, artists, scientists and people from any background are welcome to attend – no experience
  in science or hacking is necessary, just an insatiable curiosity. The event is organized by volunteers, and
  supported via sponsors. SHD India 2019 will be our 4th annual event!
  <br/><br/>
  The mission of Science Hack Day is simply to get excited and make things with science! People organically form
  multidisciplinary teams over the course of a weekend: particle physicists team up with designers, marketers
  join forces with open source rocket scientists, writers collaborate with molecular biologists, and developers
  partner with school kids. By collaborating on focused tasks during this short period, small groups of hackers
  are capable of producing remarkable results.
